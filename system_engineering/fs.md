#  Storage
A curated list of storage open source tools. Backups, redundancy, sharing, distribution, encryption, etc.

## Distributed file systems
Systems that expose a traditional file system interface with POSIX semantics.

* [Ceph file system](https://ceph.com/ceph-storage/file-system/) - Ceph’s file system runs on top of the same object storage system that provides object storage and block device interfaces. The Ceph metadata server cluster provides a service that maps the directories and file names of the file system to objects stored within RADOS clusters. The metadata server cluster can expand or contract, and it can rebalance the file system dynamically to distribute data evenly among cluster hosts. This ensures high performance and prevents heavy loads on specific hosts within the cluster.

## Cloud Sync Engine
Starting in Windows 10, version 1709, Windows provides the cloud files API. This API consists of several native Win32 and WinRT APIs that formalize support for cloud sync engines, and handles tasks such as creating and managing placeholder files and directories. Users of this API are typically sync providers and to some extent, Windows applications.

* [cfapiSync](https://github.com/styletronix/cfapiSync) - Working c# Example implementig a Cloud Sync Engine on Windows 10 / 11 based on the cloud files API. This is very early alpha.
